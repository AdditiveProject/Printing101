This can be done at the end of the lesson or during another class period. The size and duration of the print is flexible and based on your access to printers.
 
 
 
#### 3D PRINTING: AN INTRO
**WHAT EXACTLY IS 3D PRINTING, ANYWAY?**  

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process by which a three dimensional object is created using material which is laid out and fused in sequential layers. Think of an inkjet printer moving line by line down a page. Then think of a glue gun squeezing a line of glue into a shape on a table top and then retracing that shape over and over again until the layers begin to take the form of an object like a bowl. Mesh the two concepts, and you should have the idea.
 
There are several methods for printing in three dimensions. In the most common home, school and office applications, 3D printing is made possible by creating digital 3D models to very precise measurements with computer aided design (CAD) software or a 3D scanner. The models are then processed by “slicing” software, which maps out the series of layers, or slices, to be laid down to actually build the object. Most 3D printers available to the general public are  simply industrial robots that follow these maps and squeeze out, or extrude, layers of material, fusing them along the way until objects have been created.

Most 3D printers you come across will use plastic polymers to create objects. The layers are fused together by the heat at which the material is extruded. One of the most common uses for these plastic objects is to develop and refine prototypes for manufacturing, though utilitarian objects such as prosthetic hands, patient-specific medical implants, custom eyeglasses and small mechanical components are also being made.

3D printers do not only work with plastics. The technology includes metals, glass and even biological materials. Industry has rapidly embraced 3D printing in metal as the process has been refined and newer, cheaper machines have made it possible to print parts in days which used to take months. There are also many types of industrial objects which were essentially impossible to properly manufacture before 3D printing. Scientists are even now exploring the possibilities for using the technology in space to print everything from replacement parts to habitable buildings.
 
#### SUGGESTED PROCESS
#####  INTRODUCTION + Overview of 3D printing (optional)
Play the introductory video the 3D printing process. Pass around a printed object and present the associated talking points.
 
**Project overview**

Direct participants to the project website. Introduce or review the project page components they can use as reference, showing them the step-by-step instructions, the location of the Required Files (refer them to their desktops if previously installed), and point out the Tool Tips + Tutorials section. Introduce participants to the 3D printer and describe its functions and parts. Explain the 3D printing software.
 
**PROJECT Facilitation**

*OPTION 1:* With groups that do well independently, you may choose to begin the session by giving an overview of the learning objectives, as well as the tools needed to complete the project. Additionally, you might identify the goals, play the Tutorials videos, and let participants follow the step-by-step on the site.
 
*OPTION 2:* Alternatively, you may also break the session up into smaller segments or Modules, which each include several steps involving particular skills and allow for break points to check in with participants and teach the following Module’s new skills before progressing. Play Tool Tips videos and allow participants to follow the steps on the Additive site, play Tutorials videos, or demonstrate the steps to the class using projection.

##### PROJECT SETUP

**MEDIA**

Pass around a few printed objects.
 
**TALKING POINTS**

* Looking closely at the object, you should be able to identify the layers created by the 3D printer. Once an object is designed in 3D space, the printer creates coordinates for the surface area and then lays down layers of filament to build the object.
* To create large solid spaces, the printer is usually set to create a honeycomb pattern of material to serve as infill.
* As you can see on the object, the printer first lays down a thin, flat layer of material to print on. This is called the Raft.
* For parts of the object that are suspended in space, the printer first creates thin supports which are later cut away, or dissolved if using the appropriate filament.
 
 
 



 


##### MODULE 1: thingiverse + open source file sharing
**GOAL**

Navigate Thingiverse and Download a File
 
**MEDIA**

* Play the Tutorial video for [Step 1](http://youtu.be/un22Fxn2wZo?list=PLaO-nszALGbcET3pa31VYlK1gDH2eGWtx)
* OR Demonstrate opening Thingiverse and navigating through collections

**TALKING POINTS**

* Navigate to the website Thingiverse on your browser. The Thingiverse site is dedicated to sharing user-created open source design files, many of which are designed to be made on 3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines and other technologies.
* The open source movement allows users to share and modify found and created content in just about any form.
* Thingiverse, which is run by the 3D printing company MakerBot, is a massive repository of printable objects which you can browse through the Explore tab at the top of the screen. Here you are able to choose from a menu that includes Things, Customizable Things, Collections, etc. A quick glance at the Things sections offers a sense of the range of 3D models that are available to print or customize.
* 3D models are simply the mathematical representations of all three dimensions of an object’s surface which are generated by specialized programs.
* When exported to a 3D printer’s software with its various practical settings, the printer uses the mathematical coordinates of each point on the surface to determine where and how much material to place in a series of layers and filler. In this way, a 3D model can be printed as an object in the real world.
 
**MEDIA**

* Play the Tutorial video for [Step 2](http://youtu.be/oH9g86afXGQ?list=PLaO-nszALGbcET3pa31VYlK1gDH2eGWtx).
* OR Demonstrate navigating to the Thingiverse Additive Project Page, selecting and downloading a file.
 
**TALKING POINTS**

* First, some things to be aware of whenever you navigate through Thingiverse. Since these are open source files, the amount of instruction and testing can vary greatly.
* Open the file Erebor Key and look at the horizontal menu below the picture. You can see that it comes with background info and instructions, and that it has been successfully printed by a number of users among other things.
* Some files include a MakerBot verification, which simply indicates that the company has created and tested the file on its machines with success.
* User prints demonstrate that others have successfully printed and the instructions provide a how-to of printing, all of which are useful for beginners.
* Some Thingiverse projects are still in development, while others are complete and tested, and include all the necessary files to export directly to a printer.
* 3D printers use a file format called STL (for STereoLithography), which maps out the object’s surfaces. These files can be imported and modified by a printer’s software to actually print the object. If you intend to print an object, ensure you have the STL file.
* Once you have investigated the page’s properties, download the Erebor Key STL file and save it in a convenient place on your computer.
 
##### MODULE 2: importing + manipulating files; exporting to print

**GOAL**

Working with a File in MakerWare + Preparing it for Print

**TALKING POINTS**

* Open MakerWare, select Add File and navigate to the saved STL file of the object you chose from Thingiverse. The object will appear in the MakerWare print space.
* Once the file in in the print space, accept the prompt to lay the object on the platform.
* If the object is in mid air in the print space, the printer will print on the exact coordinates, but will construct physical supports to get it there, increasing the print time and amount of material used.
* MakerWare attempts to give you an accurate representation of how the object will actually be placed and printed in the printer. The dark grey plane represents the print bed and the outlines of the box represent the limits of the printing space.
* In the Settings tab, you can see that Raft is checked. The raft is a flat piece of filament laid down as a base by the printer to print on. In settings, you can also check Supports, which will show you all supports. With these two selected, you have an accurate picture of exactly what will be printed.  
* Think about the best way to orient the object for print, with fewer supports being preferable.
* Reference the demonstration object to show how different orientations would require more or less support material.

**TALKING POINTS**

* To make final adjustments before printing, select the Export tab in the top menu. A pop up will appear showing the file being prepared for print. When this is complete, the file is ready for export. The window will expand to include a Print Preview option and will indicate the estimated time to print and amount of filament used.
* For our purposes, a 20 minute print time is ideal. 
* If the print time of your object is longer than 20 minutes or so, close out of Export and return to Scale.
* Based on the print time the object had at the current size, fill in a percentage that might correspond to  20 minute print time. E.g. if the original print time was 1.5 hours as in the Tutorial, try a scale of 20% or lower for the object.
* Keep in mind that every time you scale the object, you create a new 100%. If you scaled it down to 20%, as in the Tutorial, and that is too small, you use the new size to base the percentage on (250% worked in our case). Alternatively, you can start from the original size by first selecting Reset Scale.
* Once you have the right print time, click Export Now and save the file.


##### PRINTING
Power on the printer to preheat it. The printer must be hot for the filament to adhere to itself during printing. Keep the door closed as much as possible and always when printing. 

Preheating before you are ready to print allows you to save time when you are ready.  Preheating can take up to 10 mins so if you do this while you are working on or prepping your model you will save time.  If you do not preheat your printer before you print it will begin this process when you select the model to print.  (more important to outline this in more detail in the facilitator guide.
